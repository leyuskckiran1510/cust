# wonderfull bug
- if `-fsanitize=address` is used it crashes randomly for no reason at-all
- use `-fsanitize=address` only to test build and for prod

cust = c + rust
        what does it have?
            1. eveything c provides and code beauty of c
            2. type safety, and memory safety, like rust

# what are you trying to make
I am making a c-precompiler that does type saftey 
and type checking before passing it to gcc/cland/cc(tinyc,other c compiler flavors) to comiple it


type-script is for javascript,
cust is for c,
